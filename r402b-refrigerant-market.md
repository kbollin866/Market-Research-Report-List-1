<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The R402b Refrigerant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable Steel Cylinders</li><li>Refillsble Steel Cylinders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The R402B refrigerant market comprises two primary types: disposable steel cylinders and refillable steel cylinders. Disposable steel cylinders are designed for single use and are typically pre-filled and discarded after use, making them convenient but less environmentally friendly. In contrast, refillable steel cylinders are built for repeated use, allowing for cost savings and reduced waste as they can be refilled multiple times. This distinction affects pricing, environmental impact, and customer preferences within the refrigerant supply chain.</p></p>
