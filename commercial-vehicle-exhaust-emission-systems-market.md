<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR Systems</li><li>EGR Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle exhaust emission systems market primarily includes Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. SCR systems utilize a reducing agent, typically urea, to convert harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) into harmless nitrogen and water, enhancing compliance with stringent emissions standards. EGR systems recirculate a portion of the exhaust gases back into the engine's intake, lowering combustion temperatures and reducing NOx formation. Both technologies are crucial for improving air quality and meeting regulatory requirements in the transportation sector.</p></p>
