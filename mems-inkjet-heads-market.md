<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MEMS Inkjet Heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MEMS inkjet heads are categorized into two main types: continuous inkjet and random inkjet. Continuous inkjet technology operates by generating a continuous stream of ink droplets, which can be selectively charged and directed to create precise patterns, making it suitable for high-speed printing applications. In contrast, random inkjet, often referred to as drop-on-demand, releases ink droplets only when needed, allowing for greater versatility in printing on various surfaces and reducing ink waste. Both types are essential for advancing digital printing technologies.</p></p>
