<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cuffed Endotracheal Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure-Low Volume Endotracheal Tube</li><li>Low Pressure-High Volume Endotracheal Tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cuffed endotracheal tube market is segmented into two main types: high-pressure low-volume endotracheal tubes and low-pressure high-volume endotracheal tubes. High-pressure low-volume tubes feature a small cuff that requires more pressure to inflate, providing a tighter seal but increasing risk of airway trauma. In contrast, low-pressure high-volume tubes have a larger cuff that distributes pressure more evenly, reducing the risk of injury while offering effective ventilation. Each type is chosen based on clinical requirements and patient safety.</p></p>
