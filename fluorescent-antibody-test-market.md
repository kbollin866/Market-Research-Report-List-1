<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorescent Antibody Test Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Test</li><li>Indirect Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fluorescent Antibody Test market is divided into two main types: direct and indirect tests. Direct tests involve the use of fluorescent-labeled antibodies that bind directly to specific antigens in a sample, allowing for immediate visualization under a fluorescence microscope. In contrast, indirect tests use a two-step process where an unlabeled primary antibody binds to the target antigen, followed by a fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody that attaches to the primary antibody, amplifying the signal and enhancing detection sensitivity. Both methods are crucial for diagnosing various diseases.</p></p>
