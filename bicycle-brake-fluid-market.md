<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bicycle Brake Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DOT Fluid</li><li>Mineral Oil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bicycle brake fluid market primarily features two types: DOT fluid and mineral oil. DOT fluid, derived from glycol-ether, offers excellent performance in hydraulic braking systems, providing consistent braking power under a wide temperature range. However, it is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture over time. In contrast, mineral oil is derived from petroleum and is non-hygroscopic, making it less likely to absorb water, which can enhance system longevity. Each type caters to different bike types and rider preferences.</p></p>
